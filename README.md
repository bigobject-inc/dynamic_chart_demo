## default demo charts
The default sample view consisted of four dynamic spline charts.

Please use http post to send a json data to the websocket server 127.0.0.1:8000/pub , channel "/data"

An example json:

    {"channel":"/data","chart1_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart1_d1":99,"chart1_d2":14,"chart2_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart2_d1":58,"chart2_d2":66,"chart3_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart3_d1":63,"chart3_d2":66,"chart4_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart4_d1":19,"chart4_d2":22}

You can use curl to send the data.
ex.

    curl -X POST -H "Contentype:application/json" -d '{"channel":"/data","chart1_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart1_d1":99,"chart1_d2":14,"chart2_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart2_d1":58,"chart2_d2":66,"chart3_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart3_d1":63,"chart3_d2":66,"chart4_time":"2017-04-18<br>15:19:21","chart4_d1":19,"chart4_d2":22}' localhost:8000/pub
    
or use the python testing program "test.py" to send random data

    python test.py
